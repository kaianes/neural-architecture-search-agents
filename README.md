# 🧠 Efficient Deep Neural Network Architecture Search Using AI Agents
---

## 📘 Overview

Designing deep neural network (DNN) architectures remains a complex and resource-intensive task. This project proposes an **AI Agent-based Neural Architecture Search (NAS)** framework that automates and optimizes the design process through intelligent coordination and reasoning.  
The goal is to achieve **high accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability**, aligning with **Green AI** principles.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a **multi-agent system** for automated architecture search and evaluation.  
- Optimize DNN architectures for **accuracy**, **efficiency**, and **low energy consumption**.  
- Integrate **reinforcement learning**, **Bayesian optimization**, or **evolutionary strategies** for NAS.  
- Measure and analyze **sustainability metrics** such as FLOPs, CO₂e, and model size.  
- Demonstrate reproducibility and scalability across standard datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10).
